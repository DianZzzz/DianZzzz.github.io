# Capital Market Expectations

## A Framework for Developing Capital Market Expectations

1. Specify the set of expectations needed, including the time horizon(s) to which they apply. \
2. Research the historical record.
3. Specify the method(s) and/or model(s) to be used and their information requirements.
4. Determine the best sources for information needs.
5. Interpret the current investment environment using the selected data and methods, applying experience and judgment.
6. Provide the set of expectations needed, documenting conclusions.
7. Monitor actual outcomes and compare them with expectations, providing feedback to improve the expectations-setting process.

## Challenges in forecasting

### Limitations of Economic Data
- Time lag
- Revisions to data
- Changes in definition and methodologies

### Data Measurement Errors and Biases

- `Transcription errors`
- `Survivorship bias`
- `Appraisal (smoothed) data`. For certain assets without liquid public markets, appraisal data are used in lieu of transaction data. Appraised values tend to be less volatile than market-determined values. As a result, measured volatilities are biased downward and correlations with other assets tend to be understated.

### The Limitations of Historical Estimates

- `Regime change`: Changes that stem from technological, political, legal, and regulatory environments.
- Regime changes give rise to the statistical problem of `nonstationarity`

### Biases and Uncertainties in Analysts’ Methods

- `Data-mining bias`: repeatedly searching a dataset until a statistically significant pattern emerges. Lack of an explicit economic rationale for a variable’s usefulness is a warning sign of a data-mining problem:
- `Time-period bias` ：Research findings often turn out to be sensitive to the selection of specific starting and/or ending dates
- `Model uncertainty`: whether a selected model is structurally and/or conceptually correct.
- `Parameter uncertainty`: parameters are invariably estimated with error.
- `Input uncertainty`: inputs could be incorrect or the need to proxy for an unobservable variable

## Economics Growth

### Exogenous Shocks to Growth
- Policy changes
- New products and technologies
- Geopolitics
- Natural disasters
- Natural resources/critical inputs.
- Financial crises

### Trend Growth after a Financial Crisis
- Type 1: A persistent (permanent, one-time) decline in the level of output, but the subsequent trend rate of growth is unchanged.
- Type 2: No persistent decline in the level of output, but the subsequent trend rate of growth is reduced.
- Type 3: Both a persistent decline in the level of output and a reduction in the subsequent trend rate of growth.

### Decomposition of GDP Growth
- growth from labor inputs, consisting of
  - growth in potential labor force size and
  - growth in actual labor force participation
- growth from labor productivity, consisting of
  - growth from increasing capital inputs (`capital deepening`)
  - growth in `total factor productivity`

`Aggregate market value of equity, Ve = Nominal GDP * the share of profits in the economy, Sk (earnings/GDP) * the P/E ratio (PE).`
