# Capital Market Expectations

## A Framework for Developing Capital Market Expectations

1. Specify the set of expectations needed, including the time horizon(s) to which they apply.
2. Research the historical record.
3. Specify the method(s) and/or model(s) to be used and their information requirements.
4. Determine the best sources for information needs.
5. Interpret the current investment environment using the selected data and methods, applying experience and judgment.
6. Provide the set of expectations needed, documenting conclusions.
7. Monitor actual outcomes and compare them with expectations, providing feedback to improve the expectations-setting process.

## Challenges in forecasting

### Limitations of Economic Data
- Time lag
- Revisions to data
- Changes in definition and methodologies

### Data Measurement Errors and Biases

- `Transcription errors`
- `Survivorship bias`
- `Appraisal (smoothed) data`. For certain assets without liquid public markets, appraisal data are used in lieu of transaction data. Appraised values tend to be less volatile than market-determined values. As a result, measured volatilities are biased downward and correlations with other assets tend to be understated.

### The Limitations of Historical Estimates

- `Regime change`: Changes that stem from technological, political, legal, and regulatory environments.
- Regime changes give rise to the statistical problem of `nonstationarity`

### Biases and Uncertainties in Analysts’ Methods

- `Data-mining bias`: repeatedly searching a dataset until a statistically significant pattern emerges. Lack of an explicit economic rationale for a variable’s usefulness is a warning sign of a data-mining problem:
- `Time-period bias` ：Research findings often turn out to be sensitive to the selection of specific starting and/or ending dates
- `Model uncertainty`: whether a selected model is structurally and/or conceptually correct.
- `Parameter uncertainty`: parameters are invariably estimated with error.
- `Input uncertainty`: inputs could be incorrect or the need to proxy for an unobservable variable

## Economics Growth

### Exogenous Shocks to Growth
- Policy changes
- New products and technologies
- Geopolitics
- Natural disasters
- Natural resources/critical inputs.
- Financial crises

### Trend Growth after a Financial Crisis
- Type 1: A persistent (permanent, one-time) decline in the level of output, but the subsequent trend rate of growth is unchanged.
- Type 2: No persistent decline in the level of output, but the subsequent trend rate of growth is reduced.
- Type 3: Both a persistent decline in the level of output and a reduction in the subsequent trend rate of growth.

### Decomposition of GDP Growth
- growth from labor inputs, consisting of
  - growth in potential labor force size and
  - growth in actual labor force participation
- growth from labor productivity, consisting of
  - growth from increasing capital inputs (`capital deepening`)
  - growth in `total factor productivity`

**Aggregate market value of equity, Ve = Nominal GDP * the share of profits in the economy, Sk (earnings/GDP) * the P/E ratio (PE).**

## Approaches to Economic Forecasting

### Econometric Modeling

- `Econometrics`: application of quantitative modeling and analysis grounded in economic theory to the analysis of economic data.
- `Structural models`: specify functional relationships among variables based on economic theory.
- `Reduced-form model`: more compact representations of underlying structural models. Evaluate endogenous variables in terms of observable exogenous variables.

#### Advantages
- Robust models
- New data may be collected and consistently used within models to quickly generate output.
- Delivers quantitative forecasts
- Imposes discipline/consistency on analysis.

#### Disadvantages
- Complex and time-consuming to formulate.
- Relationships not static. Model may be mis-specified.
- May give false sense of precision
- Rarely forecasts turning points well

### Economic Indicators
- `Leading economic indicator`: 
- `Lagging economic indicator`: 
- `Diffusion Index`: an index that measures how many indicators are pointing up and how many are pointing down.
- `Look-Ahead Bias`: a study relies on data or information that is not yet available or known during the study

#### Advantages
- Usually intuitive and simple in construction.
- Focuses primarily on identifying turning points.
- Data available from third parties. Easy to track.

#### Disadvantages
- History subject to frequent revision.
- “Current” data not reliable as input for historical analysis.
- Can provide false signals.
- May provide little more than binary (no/yes) directional guidance.

### Checklist Approach
- Consider a whole range of economic data to assess the economy’s future position.

#### Advantages
- Flexible. Structural changes easily incorporated. Items easily added/dropped. 
- Breadth: Can include virtually any topics, perspectives, theories, and assumptions.

#### Disadvantages
- Subjective. Arbitrary. Judgmental.
- Time-consuming. Manual process limits depth of analysis. 
- No clear mechanism for combining disparate information.
- Imposes no consistency of analysis across items or at different points in time. 

## Business Cycle

### Initial Recovery
- The economy picks up, business confidence rises, an upturn in spending on housing and consumer durables.
- Stimulative policies are still in place
- Ngative output gap is large
- Inflation is typically decelerating
- Short-term rates and government bond yields are low. 
- Cyclical assets and riskier assets typically perform well.

### Initial Recovery
- The economy picks up, business confidence rises, an upturn in spending on housing and consumer durables.
- Stimulative policies are still in place
- Ngative output gap is large
- Inflation is typically decelerating
- Short-term rates and government bond yields are low. 
- Cyclical assets and riskier assets typically perform well.

### Early Expansion
- Unemployment starts to fall 
- Output gap remains negative
- Businesses step up production and investment
- Profits typically rise rapidly. 
- Short rates are moving up as the central bank starts to withdraw stimulus put in place during the recession. 
- The yield curve is flattening. 

### Late Expansion
- Output gap closes
- Unemployment is low, profits are strong
- Both wages and inflation are rising
- Debt coverage ratios may deteriorate as balance sheets expand and interest rates rise.
- Interest rates are typically rising as monetary policy becomes restrictive.
- Stock markets often rise but may be volatile as nervous investors endeavor to detect signs of looming deceleration.
- Yield curve continues to flatten
- Cyclical assets may underperform while inflation hedges such as commodities outperform. 

### Slowdown
- Economy is slowing and approaching the eventual peak
- Inflation often continues to rise
- The yield curve may invert. Credit spreads generally widen. 
- The stock market may fall, with interest-sensitive stocks such as utilities underperforming and “quality” stocks with stable earnings performing best.

### Contraction
-  Firms cut production sharply. Profits drop sharply. 
-  Unemployment can rise quickly
-  Short-term interest rates drop, as do bond yields. 
-  The yield curve steepens substantially. 
-  The stock market declines in the earlier stages of the contraction but usually starts to rise in the later stages, well before the recovery emerges. 
-  Credit spreads typically widen and remain elevated until signs of a trough emerge 


## Inflation Expectation

### Inflation at or below expectations
- Cash Equivalents (CE) and Bonds: Neutral with stable or declining yields
- Equity: Positive with predictable economic growth 
- Real Estate (RE): Neutral with typical rates of return

### Inflation above expectations
- CE: Positive with increasing yields
- Bonds: Negative as rates increase and prices decline
- Equity: Negative, though some companies may be able to pass through inflation and do well
- RE: Positive as real asset values increase with inflation

### Deflation
- CE: Negative with approximately 0% interest rates
- Bonds: Benefits the highest-quality bonds because it increases the purchasing power of the cash flows, but it is likely to impair the creditworthiness of lower-quality debt.
- Equity: Negative as economic activity and business declines
- RE: Negative as property values generally decline

## Fiscal and Monetary Policy
- Fiscal policies: taxation and spending
- Monetary policeis: policy rates and liquidity provision

### Taylor's Rule
i*, target nominal policy rate  = r-neutral, real policy rate that would be targeted if growth is expected to be at trend and inflation on target 
                                + π-e, expected inflation rate
                                + 0.5 * (Y-e, expected real GDP growth rates - Y-trend, long-term trend in the GDP growth rate)
                                + 0.5 * (π-e, expected inflation rate - π-target, targeted inflation rate)
