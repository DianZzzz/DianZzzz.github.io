# Private Wealth Management

## Human and Financial Capital

- `Human capital` is commonly defined as the mortality-weighted net present value of an individual’s future expected labor income.
- `Financial capital` includes the tangible and intangible assets (outside of human capital) owned by an individual or household.

### Risks
- `Earnings risk` (insure with disability insurance) refers to loss in HC. Job loss and other career disruptions can reduce HC and may even lead to the need to consume FC prematurely.
- `Premature death risk` (insure with life insurance) can be a substantial HC loss. In addition, it may cause unexpected expenses that consume limited FC of the survivors.
- `Longevity risk` (insure with annuities) is where individuals who live too long are at risk of outliving their FC.
- `Property risk` (insure with property insurance) refers to sudden loss in value of physical property (FC). The loss of business property
could reduce FC and also HC of the owner if the property is necessary to generate business income.
- `Liability risk` (insure with liability insurance) refers to being legally responsible for damages and a reduction in FC.
- `Health risk` (insure with health insurance) can lead to direct loss of FC to pay illness or injury related expenses. It can reduce HC through diminished or inability to work.

## Economic Net Worth

Economic Net Worth  = Traditional Net Worth
                    + PV (future earnings + unvested pension benefits)
                    - PV (consumption goals + bequests)

## Life Insurance

- Temporary Insurance (Term Insurance)
- Permanent Insurance
  - Whole Life Insurance: fixed premium payments
  - Universal Life Insurance: more payment and investment flexibility

## Net Payment Cost Index

- Calculate the insurance cost = FV (Premiums) - FV (Dividend)
- Set the insurance cost to FV and calculate the PMT
- Net payment cost index = PMT / Face value in thousands

## Health Insurance Plan

- `Indemnity plan`, which allows the insured to go to essentially any medical service provider, but the insured must pay a specified percentage of the “reasonable and customary” fees.
- `Peferred provider organization (PPO)`, which is a large network of physicians and other medical service providers that charge lower prices to individuals within the plan than to individuals who obtain care on their own
- `Health maintenance organization (HMO)`, which allows office visits at no, or very little, cost

## Annuities

- Deferred versus Immediate
  - Deferred annuities provide income that begins at a future date after the initial purchase of the annuity.
  - Immediate payout annuities—or single-premium immediate annuities (SPIAs): the individual permanently exchanges a lump sum for a contract that promises to pay the annuitant an income for life.
- Fixed versus Variable.
  - Fixed annuities: For each dollar invested, the insurance company will tell the investor how much income he or she will receive
  - Variable annuities: the amount of the payments varies over time based on the performance of the portfolios that the assets are invested in
