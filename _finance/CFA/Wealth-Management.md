# Private Wealth Management

## Human and Financial Capital

- `Human capital` is commonly defined as the mortality-weighted net present value of an individualâ€™s future expected labor income.
- `Financial capital` includes the tangible and intangible assets (outside of human capital) owned by an individual or household.

### Risks
- `Earnings risk` (insure with disability insurance) refers to loss in HC. Job loss and other career disruptions can reduce HC and may even lead to the need to consume FC prematurely.
- `Premature death risk` (insure with life insurance) can be a substantial HC loss. In addition, it may cause unexpected expenses that consume limited FC of the survivors.
- `Longevity risk` (insure with annuities) is where individuals who live too long are at risk of outliving their FC.
- `Property risk` (insure with property insurance) refers to sudden loss in value of physical property (FC). The loss of business property
could reduce FC and also HC of the owner if the property is necessary to generate business income.
- `Liability risk` (insure with liability insurance) refers to being legally responsible for damages and a reduction in FC.
- `Health risk` (insure with health insurance) can lead to direct loss of FC to pay illness or injury related expenses. It can reduce HC through diminished or inability to work.
