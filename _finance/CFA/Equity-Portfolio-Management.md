# Equity Portfolio Management

## Benchmark

- Buffering: Establishing ranges around breakpoints that define whether a stock belongs in one index or another.
- Packeting: involves splitting stock positions into multiple parts. If a stock's capitalization increases and breaches the breakpoint between mid-cap and large-cap indexes, a portion of the total holding is transferred to the large-cap index but the rest stays in the mid-cap index.

### Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI)

HHI = Sum of Weights^2
Effective number of stocks = 1/HHI
