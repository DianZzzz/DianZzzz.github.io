# Institutional Portfolio Management

## Investment Approaches

### Norway Model

- Traditional style characterized by 60%/40% equity/fixed-income allocation, few alternatives, largely passive investments, tight tracking error limits, and benchmark as a starting position.
- Pros: Low cost, transparent, suitable for large scale, easy for board to understand.
- Cons: Limited value-added potential.

### Endowment Model
- Characterized by high alternatives exposure, active management and outsourcing.
- Pros: High value-added potential.
- Cons: Expensive and difficult to implement for most sovereign wealth funds because of their large asset sizes.

### Canada Model
- Characterized by high alternatives exposure, active management, and insourcing.
- Pros: High value-added potential and development of internal capabilities.
- Cons: Potentially expensive and difficult to manage.

### LDI Model
- Characterized by focus on hedging liabilities and interest rate risk including via duration-matched, fixed-income exposure. A growth component in the return-generating portfolio is also typical (exceptions being bank and insurance company portfolios).
- Pros: Explicit recognition of liabilities as part of the investment process.
- Cons: Certain risks (e.g., longevity risk, inflation risk) may not be hedged.

## Bank

Modified Duration of Equity = (A/E) * Asset Duration - (A/E - 1) * Liability Duration * (Δi/Δy)

Change in equity capitalization value = Δy * - modified duration

Variance of change in equity capitalization value = (A/E)^2 * asset variance + (A/E - 1) * liability variance - 2 * (A/E) 8 (A/E - 1) * Asset SD * Liability SD * Correlation
