# Institutional Portfolio Management

## Investment Strategies

- Index: Passive
- Tactical: allows short term deviations from target portfolio weight
- Dynamic: allows long term deviations from target portfolio weight

## Defined Benefit Plans
- Return: The actuarial discount rate or somewhat higher.
- Risk: Determined by plan and sponsor characteristics. Factors reducing risk tolerance include shorter time horizon, higher liquidity needs, weak sponsor, and positive correlation of sponsor results with plan asset returns.
- Time horizon: Linked to liability duration.
- Taxes: Generally untaxed.
- Legal/regulatory: A prudent expert managing the assets for the benefit of plan participants.
- Liquidity: Linked to needs for plan payouts.
- Unique: Watch for small plans with inadequate resources to complete proper due diligence.

### DB Plan Calculation
- The maximum discount rate allowed for pension plan is the high-grade bond yields averaged over the last 25 years
- The required return for the plan asset should exceed the discount rate on plan liabilities.

## Foundations and Endowments
- Return: Geometric link of distribution, relevant inflation, and expense rates.
- Risk: Often higher, may be diminished if the beneficiary is heavily dependent on the distributions.
- Time horizon: Often perpetual.
- Taxes: Generally untaxed, but watch out for specifically taxed income sources.
- Legal/regulatory: Relatively unregulated.
- Liquidity: Situation specific.
- Unique: Watch for concentrated positions, restrictions on sale, and SRI.

### Example IPS
The mission of xx University Endowment is to provide scholarships for students attending the university.

In order to achieve this mission, the Endowment must maintain the purchasing power of the assets in perpetuity while achieving investment returns sufficient to sustain the level of spending necessary to support the scholarship budget.

herefore, the investment objective of the endowment should be to achieve a total real rate of return (after inflation) of at least 6% with a reasonable level of risk.

### Investment Approaches

#### Norway Model

- Traditional style characterized by 60%/40% equity/fixed-income allocation, few alternatives, largely passive investments, tight tracking error limits, and benchmark as a starting position.
- Pros: Low cost, transparent, suitable for large scale, easy for board to understand, low management risk
- Cons: Limited value-added potential.

#### Endowment Model
- Characterized by high alternatives exposure, active management and outsourcing.
- Pros: High value-added potential.
- Cons: Expensive and difficult to implement for most sovereign wealth funds because of their asset sizes; higher costs/fees

#### Canada Model
- Characterized by high alternatives exposure, active management, and insourcing.
- Pros: High value-added potential and development of internal capabilities.
- Cons: Potentially expensive and difficult to manage.

#### LDI Model
- Characterized by focus on hedging liabilities and interest rate risk including via duration-matched, fixed-income exposure. A growth component in the return-generating portfolio is also typical (exceptions being bank and insurance company portfolios).
- Pros: Explicit recognition of liabilities as part of the investment process.
- Cons: Certain risks (e.g., longevity risk, inflation risk) may not be hedged.

## Insurance
- Return: At minimum the return assumed by the actuaries, may be set by line of business.
- Risk: Generally conservative though the surplus may be invested more aggressively.
- Time horizon: Related to duration of the liabilities, non-life tends to be shorter but with a long tail related to claims litigation.
- Taxes: Generally taxable.
- Legal/regulatory: Heavily regulated at multiple levels. Non-life is generally less regulated.
- Liquidity: Situation specific. Life is generally more predictable than non-life. Some life policies introduce disintermediation risk. Non-life may also insure replacement value making liquidity needs dependent on inflation.
- Unique: None in particular.

## Banks
- Return: Contribute to interest earnings, but the securities portfolio is primarily a residual used to manage overall asset duration and provide liquidity.
- Risk: Heavily regulated and conservative.
- Time horizon: Related to duration of the liabilities, generally shorter.
- Taxes: Generally taxable.
- Legal/regulatory: Heavily regulated at multiple levels. Subject to numerous asset and capital limits.
- Liquidity: Emphasis on highly liquid securities, mainly government securities.
- Unique: None in particular.

Modified Duration of Equity = (A/E) * Asset Duration - (A/E - 1) * Liability Duration * (Δi/Δy)

Change in equity capitalization value = Δy * - modified duration

Variance of change in equity capitalization value = (A/E)^2 * asset variance + (A/E - 1) * liability variance - 2 * (A/E) 8 (A/E - 1) * Asset SD * Liability SD * Correlation
