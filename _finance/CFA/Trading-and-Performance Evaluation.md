# Trading and Performance Evaluation

## Trading Cost

Implementation Shortfall = Execution cost + Opportunity Cost + Fees

Expanded implementation shortfall = Delay cost + Trading Cost + Opportunity Cost + Fees


Opportunity Cost = # of shares not filled * (price_t1 - price_t0)

Execution Cost = Delay Cost + Trading Cost = Actual price paid - # of shares purchased * price_t0

Delay Cost = # of shares purchased * (price_delayed - price_t0)

Trading Cost = Actual price paid - # of shares purchased * price_delayed
