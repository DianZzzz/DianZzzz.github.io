# Behavioral Finance

## Cognitive errors

- Belief Perseverance: the tendency to cling to oneâ€™s previously held beliefs irrationally or illogically.
  - Conservatism: people maintain their prior views or forecasts by inadequately incorporating new information.
  - Confirmation: people tend to look for and notice what confirms their beliefs, and to ignore or undervalue what contradicts their beliefs.
  - Reprensentativeness: people tend to classify new information based on past experiences and classifications.
    - Base-rate neglect: people rely on stereotypes when making investment decisions without adequately incorporating the base probability of the stereotype occurring.
    - Sample-size neglect: people incorrectly assume that small sample sizes are representative of populations 
  - Illusion Control: people tend to believe that they can control or influence outcomes when, in fact, they cannot.
  - Hindsight: people may see past events as having been predictable and reasonable to expect. 
- Processing Errors: information may be processed and used illogically or irrationally in financial decision making.
  - Anchoring and adjustment: the use of a psychological heuristic influences the way people estimate probabilities. 
  - Mental accounting: people treat one sum of money differently from another equal-sized sum based on which mental account the money is assigned to.
  - Framing: a person answers a question differently based on the way in which it is asked (framed)
  - Availability: people take a heuristic (sometimes called a rule of thumb or a mental shortcut) approach to estimating the probability of an outcome based on how easily the outcome comes to mind.
