# Behavioral Finance

## The Behavioral Biases of Individuals

### Cognitive errors

- `Belief Perseverance`: the tendency to cling to one’s previously held beliefs irrationally or illogically.
  - `Conservatism`: people maintain their prior views or forecasts by inadequately incorporating new information.
  - `Confirmation`: people tend to look for and notice what confirms their beliefs, and to ignore or undervalue what contradicts their beliefs.
  - `Reprensentativeness`: people tend to classify new information based on past experiences and classifications.
    - `Base-rate neglect`: people rely on stereotypes when making investment decisions without adequately incorporating the base probability of the stereotype occurring.
    - `Sample-size neglect`: people incorrectly assume that small sample sizes are representative of populations 
  - `Illusion Control`: people tend to believe that they can control or influence outcomes when, in fact, they cannot.
  - `Hindsight`: people may see past events as having been predictable and reasonable to expect. 

- `Processing Errors`: information may be processed and used illogically or irrationally in financial decision making.
  - `Anchoring and adjustment`: the use of a psychological heuristic influences the way people estimate probabilities. 
  - `Mental accounting`: people treat one sum of money differently from another equal-sized sum based on which mental account the money is assigned to.
  - `Framing`: a person answers a question differently based on the way in which it is asked (framed)
  - `Availability`: people take a heuristic (sometimes called a rule of thumb or a mental shortcut) approach to estimating the probability of an outcome based on how easily the outcome comes to mind.
    - `retrievability`: if an answer or idea comes to mind more quickly than another answer or idea, the first answer or idea will likely be chosen as correct even if it is not the reality
    - `categorization`: if an answer or idea comes to mind more quickly than another answer or idea, the first answer or idea will likely be chosen as correct even if it is not the reality
    - `narrow range of experience`: a person with a narrow range of experience uses too narrow a frame of reference when making an estimate.
    - `resonance`: people are often biased by how closely a situation parallels their own personal situation.

### Emotional biases

- `Loss-aversion bias`:people tend to strongly prefer avoiding losses as opposed to achieving gains.
  - `Disposition effect`: the holding (not selling) of investments that have experienced losses (losers) too long, and the selling (not holding) of investments that have experienced gains (winners) too quickly.
  - `Myopic Loss Aversion`: investors presented with annual return data for stocks and bonds tend to adopt more conservative strategies (lower allocation to equities) than those presented with longer-term return data
 - `Overconfidence bias`:people demonstrate unwarranted faith in their own intuitive reasoning, judgments, and/or cognitive abilities. 
    - `Prediction overconfidence`: the confidence intervals that people assign to their investment predictions are too narrow. 
    - `Prediction overconfidence`: the confidence intervals that people assign to their investment predictions are too narrow. 
 - `Self-attribution bias`: success is attributed to the individual’s skill, while failures are attributed to external factors.
 - `Self-Control Bias`: people fail to act in pursuit of their long-term, overarching goals because of a lack of self-discipline
 - `Status Quo Bias`: people choose to do nothing (i.e., maintain the “status quo”) instead of making a change. 
 - `Endowment Bias`: people value an asset more when they hold rights to it than when they do not
 - `Regret-Aversion Bias`: people tend to avoid making decisions that will result in action out of fear that the decision will turn out poorly.

## Behavioral Finance and Investment Processes

### Investor Types

#### Barnewall Two-Way Model

- Passive Investors
  - investors who have become wealthy passively—corporate executives, big firm lawyers or CPAs, heirs 
  - the smaller the economic resources an investor has, the more likely the person is to be a passive investor
  - higher security need and a lower tolerance for risk

- Active Investors
  - individuals who have been actively involved in wealth creation through investment
  - have a higher tolerance for risk than they have need for security. 

#### Bailard, Biehl, and Kaiser Model
