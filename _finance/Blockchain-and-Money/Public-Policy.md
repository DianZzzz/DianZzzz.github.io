## Public Policy Framework
*  Guarding Against Illicit Activity
*  Financial Stability
*  Protecting the Investing Public 

> Authorities need to decide whether to isolate, regulate or integrate crypto-assets and their associated activities.
> Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, March 2, 2018

### Guarding Against Illicit Activity
- Tax Compliance and Reporting
  - Definition: currency or property? Most jurisdictions define cryptocurrency as a property
  - Tax treatment - Mining is an income 
  - Reporting: Individuals, brokers, 1099-Bs & Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts 
- Bank Secrecy Act
  - KYC (Know your customer) and AML (Anti money laundering) and CTF (Counter terrorism finance)
  - Report obligations on large transactions (> $10,000)
- Challenges
  - Pseudonymous Addresses
  - Privacy Coins & Mixers or Tumblers
  - Compliance and Reporting
  - Crypto to Crypto Transactions
  - Decentralized Exchanges
  - Dark Markets
  - State Actors

### Financial Stability
*  Capital Control: RMB -> Electricity -> Bitcoin -> Dollar
*  Crypto Leverage
*  Blockchain Market Infrastructure
*  Central Bank Digital Currencies & Stable Value Tokens 

### Protecting the Investing Public 
*  Crypto markets readily subject to fraud, scams, and manipulation
*  Custodial Arrangements - Exchange and Wallets
*  Definitions – Securities, Commodities or Derivatives?
*  Tracking Beneficial Ownership of Crypto Assets
*  Remediation of Non compliant ICOs & Exchanges
*  Personal Data Privacy

#### Investor Protection
Investor Protection goes beyond Consumer Protection:
*  Investors get Full & Fair Disclosure from Issuers
*  Fraud & Deceptive Sales Practices Prohibited
*  Secondary Markets Promoted w/ Price Transparency & Anti-Manipulation
*  Advisors’ Conflicts of Interest Disclosed and Minimized

#### The Howey Test (1946):
*  Is it an investment of money or assets?
*  Is the investment in a common enterprise?
*  Is there a reasonable expectation of profits?
*  Is it reliant on the efforts of a promoter or others? 

#### The Duck Test
“When I see a bird that walks like a duck and swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck.” James Whitcomb Riley, poet
