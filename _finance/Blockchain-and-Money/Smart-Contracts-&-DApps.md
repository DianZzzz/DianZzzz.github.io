## Initial Coin Offerings 
*  Proceeds used to build networks
*  Tokens usually issued prior to being functional
*  Development, while open source, is largely centralized

*  Tokens are fungible & transferable
*  Scarcity is fostered with preset ‘Monetary policy’
*  Purchasers anticipate profits through appreciation
