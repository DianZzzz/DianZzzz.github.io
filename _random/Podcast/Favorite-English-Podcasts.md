I use Google Podcast to listen to English podcastsã€‚

The list is in alphbetic order.

I usually only pick the episodes on the brands I am interested in and Guy Raz definitely has his distinct style

## Invest Like the Best with Patrick O'Shaughnessy
Some episodes are more interesting than others and long ads

Interesting quickbites over a wide range of topics
