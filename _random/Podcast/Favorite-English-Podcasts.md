# My Favorite English Podcasts

I use Google Podcast to listen to English podcasts and the list is in alphbetic order.

## Planet Money
Interesting quickbites over a wide range of topics

## Invest Like the Best with Patrick O'Shaughnessy
Some episodes are more interesting than others and long ads

## How I Built This with Guy Raz
I usually only pick the episodes on the brands I am interested in and Guy Raz definitely has his distinct style
