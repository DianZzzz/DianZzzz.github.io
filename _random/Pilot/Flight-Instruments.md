## Altimeter
- Reading
  - Tiny white hand - 10,000'
  - Fat hand - 1,000'
  - Long hand - 100'
- Altitude
  - True - actual height above sea level, expressed as Ft MSL
  - Indicated - what is shown on altimeter
  - Absolute - height above the ground, expressed as Ft AGL
  - Pressure - at 29.92 inches Hg at 15 celcius 
  - Density - pressure altitude corrected for non-standard temperature.

## Heading indicator
- AKA directional gyro, horizontal situational indicator
- Must be periodically realigned
- The NAV warning flag indicates no reliablesignal is being received. 
- The HDG flag indicates the compass card is not functioning properly.

## Turn coordinator
- The ball part is called an inclinometer

## Vertical speed indicator

- Indicates whether the aircraft is climbing, descending, or in level flight. - The rate of climb or descent is indicated in feet per minute (fpm). 
- If properly calibrated, the VSI indicates zero in level flight.

## Airspeed indicator

- White arc: AKA flap range, approaches and landings are usually flown at
speeds within the white arc. 
- VS0: Lower limit of white arc — the stalling speed or the minimum steady flight speed in the landing configuration.
- VFE: Upper limit of the white arc — the maximum speed with the flaps extended. 
- Green arc: the normal operating range of the aircraft. Most flying occurs within this range.
- VS1: Lower limit of green arc, the stalling speed or the minimum steady flight speed in the clean configuration (gear up, if retractable, and flaps up).
- VN0: Upper limit of green arc (VN0)—the maximum structural cruising speed. Do not exceed this speed except in smooth air.
- Yellow arc: caution range. Fly within this range only in smooth air and then only with caution.
- VNE: Red line — never exceed speed. Operating above this speed is prohibited since it may result in damage or structural failure.

## Magnetic Compass

### Magnetic variation

- Difference between true north and magnetic north
- **East is least, West is best**: subtract easterly variation or add westerly variation

### Magnetic dip

- As one gets closer to the North or South Pole, compass magnets dip towards the low side of a turn. 
- This error isn't much of a problem near the equator

### Acceleration and deceleration error

- In the Northern Hemisphere, as one accelerates, the compass will show a turn to the North and vice versa
- ANDS: "Accelerate-North, Decelerate-South."

### Turning Errors

- During a turn from a Northerly heading, the compass briefly indicates a turn in the opposite direction. 
- During a turn from a Southerly heading, the compass indicates a turn in the correct direction, but at a faster rate than is actually being turned.
- NOSE: "North-Opposite, South-Exaggerated."
