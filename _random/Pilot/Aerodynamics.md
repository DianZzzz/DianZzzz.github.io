# Aerodynamics

## Four forces

## Bernoulli's Principle of Differential Pressure

- As the speed of air increases, its pressure will decrease
- The upper surface of the wing is curved and the lower surface is relatively flat, thus decreasing the pressure on top of the wing and being the major source of the lift that makes an airplane fly

## Airplane components

## Airplane controls

- Ailerons control roll - turning the control yoke right, the right aileron is up and the left aileron is down, and the airplane banks right
- Elevator controls pitch - pulling the control yoke pitches the nose up and vice versa 
- Rudder controls yaw - pushing the right rudder pedal moves the rudder  to the right and the airplane yaws to the right

### Adverse Yaw
- The tendency of an airplane to yaw in the opposite direction of the turn.
- When rolling airplane to the right, right aileron goes up, and left aileron goes down, changing the chord line of the wing. AOA increases for the left wing and decreases for the right wing

- Thus, lift increases on the left wing, as well as induced drag. With more drag on the left wing then the left wing, the airplane will yaw to the left
- To counter adverse yaw, pushing the rudder paddle to the right


## Angle of attack (AOA)
- The acute angle between the chord line of the airfoil and the direction of the wind

- At low speed, the airflow over the top of the wing slows down and lift becomes less than weight. To maintain level flight, AOA can be increased to generate extra lift

- Critical AOA: above a wingâ€™s critical AOA, the flow of air separates from the upper surface and backfills which reduces lift and increases drag, which can lead to loss of control and an abrupt loss of altitude if the AOA is not
reduced.
