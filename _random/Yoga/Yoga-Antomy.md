# Yoga Anatomy

## Useful Terms

- `Superior & Inferior`: higher & lower
- `Anterior & Posterior`: front & back
- `Dorsal & Ventral`: front & back
- `Medial & Lateral`: towards & away from the midline
- `Proximal & Distal`: closer & further away from the origin
- `Superficial & Deep`: external & internal

## Motions

- `Flexion & Extension`: decreasing & increasing the angle betwen two body parts, e.g. elbow
- `Abduction & Adduction`: movement away & towards the midline, e.g. arm, hip, finger and toes
- `Eversion & Inversion`: Tilting of the foot so the sole faces away from / towards the midline.
- `External & Internal Rotation`: movement of limbs away from / towards the midline.
- `Elevation & Depression`: movement in a superior / inferior direction
- `Pronation & Supination`: inward & outward rolling of foot and arms 
- `Dorsiflexion & Plantarflexion`: hand or foot pointing upward / downward
- `Circumduction`: circular movement of the limbs


## Muscles

### Four major functions of muscles

- Energize the body
- Protect internal organs
- Generate movement
- Maintain posture

### Muscle origins & insertion

- Origin: the point on the immobile bone where the muscle attaches
- Insertion: the point on the bone which is moved by the action of the muscle

### Three operating groups of muscle

- `Agonists`: these muscles cause the movement to occur. aka `primer movers`
- `Antagonists`: these muscles act in opposition to the movement generated by the agonists and are responsible for returning a limb to its initial position.
- `Synergists`: these muscles assit in performing the same set of joint motion as the agonists by neutralizing extra motion from the agonists, aka `neutralizers or fixators`

### Three types of muscle contractions

- `Concentric`: muscles shorten while generating force, overcoming resistance.
- `Eccentric`: muscle lengthens while generating force but resistance is greater than force generated.
- `Isometric`: musle generates force without changing the length 

### Connective tissue

- `Fascia`: the most superficial layer of the muscles and connects the musle to each other
- `Tendon`: connects muscle to bone
- `Ligament`: connects bone to bone

## Skeletal

### Spine

The spine column is comprsied of 33 vertebrae for infant and 26 verterbrae for aduts (some bones are fused)

- 7 cervical vertebrae (neck/head): C1 - C7
- 12 thoracic vertebrae (shoulder/trunk): T1 - T12
- 5 lumbar vertebrae (lower back): L1 - L5
- 5 sacral vertebrae (sacrum): fused as one in adult
- 4 coccygeal vertebrae (tailbone): fused as one in adult

### Skeleton 

The skeleton of an adult is made up of approx. 206 bones

- Axial skeleton: skull, spine and rib cage
- Appendicular skeleton: limbs and shoulder & hip joint

#### Categorizations of skeleton bones

- Long bones: for leverage
- Flat bones: for protection
- Short bones: weight bearing

## Special Bones

- `Ribs`: Human have 24 ribs (12 pairs)
- `Sternum`: aka breastbone, a long flat bone in the center of the chest
- `Clavicle`: aka collarbone, a long bone between the shoulder blade and the sternum; the only long bone in the body that lies horizontally
- `Scapula`: aka shoulder blade, a triangular bone that connects upper arm bone with the clavicle
- `Femur`: aka highbone, the strongest and the longest bone in th ebody
- `Patella`: aka kneecap
- `Tibia`: main bone of the leg, second largest bone
- `Fibula`: aka calf bone, located on the lateral side of the tibia, the slenderest of all the long bones
- `Humerus`: the long bone in the upper arm
- `Radius & Ulna`: two large bones in the lower arm
- `Tarsals`: aka ankle bones
- `Phalanges`: aka toe/finger bones

## Joints

Joints, aka articulation, are spaces where two bones meet.

### Categorization of joints

- `Fibrous joints`: aka synarthrotic joints, are immobile or extremely limited in movement
    - Connected by dense connective tissue consisting mainly of collagen
    - e.g. skull
- `Cartilaginous joints`: aka amphiarthrotic joints, are limited in movement
    - Connected by cartilage
    - e.g. pelvis girdle
- `Synovial joints`: diarthrotic joints, are most mobile and make up 80% of joints in the body
    - Connected with a fibrous joint capsule filled with syovial fluid
    - Falls into one of four categories
        - Hinge, e.g. fingers and toes, ankle, elbow and knee joints
        - Ball and socket, e.g. hip and shoulder joints
        - Pivot, e.g. neck
        - Gliding, e.g. wrist
    
### Torque

- The force applied to the joint by the bones

## Nervous System

- Central nervous system
    - Brain
    - Spinal cord
- Peripheral nervous system
    - Cranial nerves
    - Spinal serves

### Neurons

- Sensory neurons - carry messages received from outside stimuli to the brain
- Motor neurons - carry messages to the muscles
- Interneurons - carry messages from one neuron to another

### Autonomic nervous system

- Parasympathetic nervous system: regulates "rest and digest" functions
- Sympathetic nervous system: controls "fight or flight" responses
