1. Confidentiality: restrict access to only authorized subjects, e.g. encryption
2. Integrity: maintain the consistency and accuracy of data over its entire life cycle, e.g. hash value
3. Availability: keep the operations up and runing. e.g. maintenance and upgrade of hardware and software

## Key Terms

1. Vulnerability: a flaw or a loophole that can be exploited to threaten security
2. Threat: an event able to cause negative impact
3. Exploit: a defined way to breach the security of an IT system through a vulnerability
4. Risk: the likelihood of a vulnerability to be exploited
