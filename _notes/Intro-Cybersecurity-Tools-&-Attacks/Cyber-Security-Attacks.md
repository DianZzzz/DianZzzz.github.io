# Cyber Security Attacks

## Attack Classficiation

### Passive Attacks
1. Evesdropping 
*  Because it is not detected, it can go on for a long time and get the actual content of the message

2. Traffic Analysis
*  Look at frequency and the size of the message

Passive attacks are hard to detect becuase it is hard to prove that the message has been altered. 

### Active Attacks
1. Masquerade
