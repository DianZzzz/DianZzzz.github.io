# Cyber Kill Chain

A model created by [Lockheed Martin](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed-martin/rms/documents/cyber/LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven-Defense.pdf) that borrows a military concept and reapplies to cybersecurity. 

## 1. Reconnaissance
Attackers gather information about the target and the tactics for attack

## 2. Weaponization
Attackers develop their malware to prepare for the attack

## 3. Delivery
Attackers transmit the malware to the victim

## 4. Exploitation
The malware "detonates" and starts to exploit vulnerability

## 5. Installation
The malware installs access point that provide access to the attacker

## 6. Command and Control
The attacker takes over the victim's system and network

## 7. Action on Objective
The attacker execute actions to achieve their goals
