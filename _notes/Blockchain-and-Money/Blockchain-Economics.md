# Blockchain Economics

## Verification - Tracking, Settling & Enforcing Transactions and Contracts

Ability to Lower Costs to Verify Transactions, Particularly Digital Assets
- Direct Costs
- Privacy and Data Leakage Costs
- Censorship Risks
- Settlement - Timeliness and Certainty of Finality
- Costs of Trust: Code & Consensus Protocol vs. Trust in Central Intermediary
- Economic Rents due to Market Power 

## Networking – Moving Property Rights across a Network
- Ability to Lower Costs to Develop and Operate a Network
- Tokens provide Opportunity to Pre Fund Development
- Tokens provide Incentive Mechanism During Operating Phase

## Metcalfe's Law

## Blockchain vs. Internet 
- Both Open protocols
- Both Transport packets of data on distributed networks: Property Rights vs. Content
- Both can have Apps built upon Protocol or Cryptocurrency level
- Both said to be Open Network Development, though centralized through groups such as ICANN or Bitcoin Core Developers
- Interoperability: A Blockchain is akin to a Private Intranet vs. the Internet
- Incentives – Registrars and Registries vs. Miners
- Origins in Relation to Governments – Founded by Government Research Projectvs vs. Came Out of Cyberpunk Libtertarian Anti-goverment sentiment
- Significant Investment – Blockchain far earlier than Internet

## The Minimalists
- High Mining & Transactions Costs Inherent to Design
- Many Technical Challenges: Scalability, Performance, Privacy, Security, Interoperability & Governance
- Tokens Lack Intrinsic Value
- Volatility of Token Prices - Poor Store of Value
- Limited Adoption as a Medium of Exchange or Unit of Account
- Not accepted for Taxes or as Legal Tender - No ‘Tether’
- Having Multiple Currencies Counter to Economic History and Logic
- Token Monetary Policy in Code subject to Consensus Changes with no Central Bank 
- Blockchain Applications tend towards Centralization: Mining Pools, Crypto Exchanges, Software Development, Holders & Alternative Consensus Protocols
- If Private Key is Lost or Stolen it is gone Forever
- Buterin’s Trilemma – Decentralization, Scalability and Security
- Doubt Claims of benefits of Token Economics
- No ‘Killer App’ or Production Use Enterprise App yet
- Scams, Frauds, & Manipulation on Crypto Exchanges and with ICOs
- Illicit Activities – Tax Avoidance, Drug Running, Money Laundering
