- Decentralized Exchanges are networks for peer-to-peer trading. They are matching agents but not counterparties or custodians
- Responsible for over 95% of crypto transactions

## Crypto Wallets
- Hot Wallet - Connected to the Web
- Cold Wallet - A physical device that keeps cryptocurrency completely offline

## Crypto Exchange Public Policy Challenges
- Markets Readily subject to Fraud, Scams, and Manipulation
- Custodial Arrangements - Exchanges and Wallets
- Complying with AML/KYC and implementing Tax Reporting
- Definitions – Securities, Commodities or Derivatives?
- Tracking Beneficial Ownership
- Remediation of Non compliant Exchanges

## Investor Protection goes beyond Consumer Protection:
