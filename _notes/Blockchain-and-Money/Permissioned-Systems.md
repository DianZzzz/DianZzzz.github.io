# Permissioned Systems

## Key Design Features
*   Membership Limited to Authorized Nodes
*   Transactions can also be Limited to Authorized Known Participants
*   Data & Ledgers can be partitioned to keep amongst subgroups of nodes
*   Consensus built on permissioned, private Protocols – globally or modular between transacting parties.
*   Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance
*   Delegated Notary Nodes
*   Diverse Protocols – from Protocols for Multi Party Consensus to Crash Fault Tolerant for 1 Party
*   Uses cryptography and registration authorities to mask user data
*   Facilitates Smart Contracts using Chaincode or other programming language
*   No Native Currency – Possible, though, with Smart Contracts
*   Code generally open source

## Permissioned Private Blockchains vs. Traditional Databases
*   Append-only Timestamped Logs vs. Create, Read, Update, and Delete (‘CRUD’) 
*   Cryptographic commitment schemes for data vs. Manual commitment

## Public Blockchain
*   Public write capability
*   Peer to peer transactions
*   No central intermediaries
*   Token economics

## Private blockchain
*   Private write capability
*   Finality of data in append only log
*   Public verifiability

## Traditional Databases
*  Trusted party hosts data
*  Trusted party can "CRUD"
*  Client Server Architecture
