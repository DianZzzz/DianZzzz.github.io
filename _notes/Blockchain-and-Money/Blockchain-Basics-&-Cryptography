# Blockchain Basics & Cryptography

## Cryptographic Hash Function
*  Convert any input into a unique fixed length output/a hash
*  Deterministic: the same input always lead to the same output/hash
*  Can be efficiently computed
*  Preimage resistant: it's infeasible to reverse engineer (not mathematically impossible)
*  Collision resistant: it's infeasible that two inputs will generae the same hash
*  Avalenche effect: Changing the input slightly will completely change the has
*  Puzzle friendliness: knowing the part of the input will not help much in finding the rest of the input
