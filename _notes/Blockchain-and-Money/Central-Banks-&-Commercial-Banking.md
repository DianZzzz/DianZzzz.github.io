## Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)
- Central Banks Currently Issue Digital Reserves to Commercial banks and Physical Tokens (Cash and Coin) to Public
- Commercial Banks Provide Digital Currency (Deposits) to Public, Essentially a form of Intermediated CBDC
- Private Sector is Experimenting with Stable Value Tokens
- Strategic question: Should Direct Access to Digital Reserves (from central bank to the public) be Expanded?

## CBDC - Opportunities
- Continue Government Provision of a Means of Payment
- Promote Competition in Banking System

- Resilience of Open Payment Infrastructures

## CBDC – Design Considerations
- Widely Accessible vs. Wholesale
- Token (e-Money) or Account (e-Deposit) based
- Issuer – Central Bank, Commercial Bank or Others
- Degree of Anonymity
- Transfer Mechanism
- Limits or Caps
- Interest Bearing and Level of Account Services 

## Private Sector Stable Value Tokens
- Fiat Collateralized: Tether, TrueUSD
- Crypto Collateralized: BitShare, Dai, Havven
