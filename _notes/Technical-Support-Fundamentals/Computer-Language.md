# Computer Language

`Computer` is a device that stores and processes data by performing calculations. 

`Algorithm` is a series of steps that solve specific problems. 

`Binary System` is the communication system of the computer, also known as a `base-2 numeral system`

Each number, 0 or 1, is a `bit`; 8 bits is a `byte`; 1 byte can store one character

h in decimal = 104            128  64  32  16  8   4   2   1
h in binary = 01101000         0   1   1   0   1   0   0   0     64+32+8 = 104
