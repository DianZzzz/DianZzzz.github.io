## Types of Learning

### Supervised Learning 
- Labelded data is used for training
- Task-driven - make a prediction
- eg. classification, regresssion

### Unsupervised Learning
- Unlabelled data is used for training
- Data-driven - recognize a pattern
- e.g. clustering, association

### Reinforcement Learning 
- No data; an environment and an ML model that generates data to reach a goal
- Decision-driven
- e.g. Game AI, Robot Navigation

## Neural Network
- Algorithms trying to mimick the brain
- Data is input into a neuron - which represents an algorithm and the output is passed to one of many other connected neurons
- The connection between neurons is weighted and the network is organized in layers - 1 input layer, 1 to many hidden layers, 1 output layer
- A neural network that has 3 or more hidden layers is considered **deep learning**
