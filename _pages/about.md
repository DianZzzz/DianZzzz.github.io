## My Life Story as a Cardi B Rap Song Written by GPT3

Why they be hatin' on me?\
I'm the girl who loves to roam free\
I'm the one with a pedigree\
Born in China then to Singapore\ 
Now I'm here working in the US 

Started my life in China, filled up with possibilities 
Loved to ride my tricycle, living carefree 
Headed to Singapore for my higher education 
Got the grades to secure a future of distinction 

From Singapore went to the US to gain some more cred 
Had to work my way through college, there was no backlog of dough 
Became a hedge fund analyst, made buckets of dough 
But I gotta move up and find something new, had to be bold 

Leave the fund and found me a new profession 
Started on the path of becoming an AI obsessor 
Learned to master data science, nothing left to guess 
Living off of pepper love and double shot espresso 

No one's gonna tell me to give up what I'm building 
Cause everyday I'm grinding, and my knowledge just keep on expanding 
Built a portfolio of experiences and go explore new restaurants 
I'm the girl who loves to roam free, there ain't no government preventing.
