## Clouds

### Four basic types
- **Stratus**: sheet like clouds
![](/assets/2022-11-25-22-04-51.png)
- **Cumulus**: puffy clouds
![](/assets/2022-11-25-22-04-39.png)
- **Cirrus**: wispy clouds
![](/assets/2022-11-25-22-05-09.png)
- **Nimbus**: rain clouds

### Low clouds

- Surface to 6,500 feet AGL
- Usually consist entirely of water but sometimes ice as well
- Types
  - Stratus
  - Stratocumulus

  - Nimbostratus
![](/assets/2022-11-25-22-11-28.png)

### Middle clouds
- 6,500 AGL to 20,000 AGL
- Composed of water, ice crystals or supercooled water
- Types
  - Altostratus

  - Altocumulus
![](/assets/2022-11-25-22-19-46.png)

### High clouds
- Above 20,000 AGL
- Generally are white and gray
- Form in stable air
- Types
  - Cirrus
  - Cirrostratus
  - Cirrocumulus

### Clouds with vertical development
- Cumulus
- Towering Cumulus
- Cumulonimbus

## Fog

- Radiation, or Ground Fog
  - Forms in moist air over low, flat areas on clear, calm nights with relatively little to no wind
- Advection Fog
  - Warm, moist air blows from the south and comes in contact with cool moisture on the ground, forming fog
- Upslop Fog
  - As moist wind blows toward a mountatin, it rises up and cools down, forming fog
- Steam Fog
  - Cold, dry aira moves over warm water. As water evporates and forms fog.
  - Commonly associated with low-level turbulence and icing
- Ice Fog
  - Forms in cold weather when water vpor forms directly into ice crystals
  - Typically in arctic regions

## Fronts

![](/assets/2022-11-26-01-21-04.png)

- Cold front
  - Cold air advances and replaces warm air
![](/assets/2022-11-26-01-15-40.png)
- Warm front
  - Warm air advances and replaces cold air
 ![](/assets/2022-11-26-01-15-18.png)
- Stationary front
  - When the cold air and warm air are relatively equal, there will be little to no movement
- Occluded front
  - When warm air gets caught bewteen two cold air masses

## Turbulence

### Low level turbulence
- Caused by surface heating or friction (less than 15,000 MSL)
- Mechanical: 
  - Winds blowing around hangars, trees, buildings
- Convective:
  - As solar radiation heats the ground during the morning and afternoon generating thermals that move away from the ground, creating chaotic patterns
  - When moisture present, towering cumulus clouds indicate a presence of convective turbulence
- Frontal:
  - The lifting of the warm air by the sloping frontal surface and friction between warm airmass and cold airmass produce turbulence in the frontal zone

- Wave Turblence
  - Wing tip vortices are created when an airplane generates lift

## Clear Air Turbulence
- Normally above 15,000 ft MSL
- Associated with wind sheer, a sudden change of wind velocity and/or direction.

## Mountain Wave Turbulence
- When strong winds blow across a mountain range and when air is stable

## Structural Icing

### Rime icing
  - Brittle and frost-like, easy to remove
  - Its irregular shape and rough surface make it very effective in reducing lift and increasing drag

### Clear icing
- Hard and glossy, difficult to remove

### Mixed icing
- Hard, rough conglomerate, hard to remove
