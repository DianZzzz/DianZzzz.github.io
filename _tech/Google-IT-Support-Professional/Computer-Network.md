1. Physical Layer: represents physical devices that interconnect computers, i.e. specifications for the netowrking cables and connectors
2. Data Link Layer: responsible for defining a common way of interpreting signals so network devices can communicate
3. Network Layer: allows different networks to communicate with each other through routers
4. Transport Layer: sorts out which client and server programs are supposed to get the data
5. Application Layer: where network applications live, e.g. emails and web browsers
