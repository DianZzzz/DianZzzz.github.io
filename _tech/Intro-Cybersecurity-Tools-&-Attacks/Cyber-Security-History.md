## Operation Clipper Chip
Developed by the NSA which allowed the government to put a chip like device on landlines to spy on communication

## Operation Solar Sunrise
Two teenage kids from California exploited a known vulnerability in the DoD operating system and launched a series of attacks which followed the classic pattern of 
1. probing to determine if the vulnerability exists, 
2. exploiting the vulnerability
3. implanting a program (sniffer) to gather data
4. returning later to retrieve the collected data.

## Operation Moonlight Maze
Supposedly and very likely launched by Russia, or at the time Soviet Union, which used proxy computers to start probably the first-ever cybersecurity warfare

## Operation Buckshoot Yankee
A USB drive containing a virus was inserted into a computer that was connected to the DoD network, maybe by China. 

## Operation Thunder Storm 
US military hacked the radars used by Saddam Hussein and fed them false information
