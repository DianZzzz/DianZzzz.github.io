# Cyber Security Attacks

## Attack Classficiation

### Passive Attacks
1. Evesdropping: because it is not detected, it can go on for a long time and get the actual content of the message
2. Traffic Analysis: look at frequency and the size of the message

Passive attacks are hard to detect becuase it is hard to prove that the message has been altered. 

### Active Attacks
1. Masquerade: take on false identity
2. Replay: capture the message and resend it at a later time under the disguise of authenticated messages
3. Modification
4. Denial of Service: the message never gets through
