# What Is Web 3

The best description of Web 1&2&3 I have come across:

`Web1：所见即所得 What you saw is what you get`

`Web2: 所荐即所得 What you were recommended is what you get`

`Web3：所建即所得 What you built is what you get`

## Web 3 Benefits
*   Democracy: decentralization shifts the power balance away from big corporations toward inviduals
*   Equality: everyone can access Web3
*   Transparency: public information is accessible to all
*   Privacy: greater protection of personal data

## Web 3 Costs
*   Chaos: people can say whatever they want 
*   Energy Intensive: mining uses lots of energy; sharing files across multiple servers also uses more energy than central storage
