# James Webb Space Telescope

Before learning about JWST, I thought working in finance and trading millions of dollar must be the most stressful work in the world. 

How naive I am. 

JWST is decades of work by thousands of scientists & engineers with billions of dollars invested taking place millions of miles away from earth...

I can't imagine the stress level when they hit the launch buttom. 

Finger crossed and wish the mission best of luck!
