This is an excerpt from the fantastic [blockchain security handbook](https://github.com/slowmist/Blockchain-dark-forest-selfguard-handbook) written by 余弦 [@evilcos](https://twitter.com/evilcos) from [SlowMist](https://www.slowmist.com/en/#home), which I helped translated from Chinese to English. Please enjoy.

## Blockchain Shenanigans

Blockchain technology created a whole new industry. Whether you call it BlockFi, DeFi, cryptocurrency, virtual currency, digital currency, Web3, etc, the core of everything is still the blockchain.  Most hype centered on financial activities, such as crypto assets, including non-fungible tokens (or NFT, digital collectible).

Blockchain industry is highly dynamic and fascinating, but there are just too many ways to do evil. The special characteristics of blockchain give rise to some rather unique evils, including and not limited to crypto theft, cryptojacking, ransomware, dark web trading, C2 attack, money laundering, Ponzi schemes, gambling, etc. I made a mind map back in 2019 for reference.

Meanwhile, the SlowMist team has been maintaining and updating SlowMist Hacked - an growing database for blockchain-related hacking activities

This handbook has introduced many security measures, and if you can apply them to your own security, then congratulations. I won’t elaborate too much on the blockchain shenanigans. If you are interested, you can learn it on your own, which is definitely a good thing, especially since new scams and frauds are continuously evolving. The more you learn, the better you can defend yourself and make this industry better.

## What to do when you get hacked

It is only a matter of time before you eventually get hacked. So what to do then? I'll simply cut straight to the chase. The following steps are not necessarily in order; there are times when you have to go back and forth, but the general idea is this.

### Stop Loss First
Stop loss is about limiting your loss. It can be broken down to at least two phases.

**The Immediate Action Phase**. Act immediately! If you see hackers are transferring your assets, think no more. Just Hurry up and transfer the remaining assets to a safe place. If you have experience in front running trades, just grab and run. Depending on the type of asset, if you can freeze your assets on the blockchain, do it as soon as possible; if you can do on-chain analysis and find your assets are transferred into a centralized exchange, you can contact their risk control department.  

**The Post-Action Phase**. Once the situation is stabilized, your focus should be on making sure there would not be secondary or tertiary attacks.
